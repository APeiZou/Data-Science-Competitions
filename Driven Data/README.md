## Background

DrivenData runs machine learning competitions to help non-profits, NGOs, governments, and other social impact organizations use data science in service of humanity. Part of DrivenData's mission is to enable data scientists and non-profits to learn from the work that is done in these competitions. To this end, the code submitted by winners is released under an open source license for others to learn from, use, and adapt.
